# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Dr. César Sauvage is an Oceanographer Researcher at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, working with Dr. Hyodae Seo. My research focuses on advancing our understanding of air-sea interactions and exploring how the ocean influences both regional weather and climate. To address these complex issues, I utilize coupled Earth system models, such as the SCOAR Regional Coupled Mode, which simulate interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, and surface waves. In addition to numerical simulations, I extensively analyze observational datasets of the marine boundary layer to evaluate current modeling capabilities and identify areas for improvement. Improving the representation of air-sea interactions in these models is crucial, not only for enhancing weather forecasts but also for optimizing offshore wind energy assessments..
